							ADVISORY
						p.
							DataHarvest is built as a neutral partner. We have decades of experience with data services. We advocate for the farmer to retain control of their data and only pay for services that return measurable improvements to the bottom line…not just pretty pictures.

In addition, we are actively testing new approaches with our partners to make sure we can find the data you will need tomorrow.
